AutoGaze (Autoregressive Gazing) is a model that automatically selects informative patches and remove redundant ones in any video, such that downstream ViTs/MLLMs can process fewer patches without informaiton loss. This makes downstream ViTs/MLLMs much more scalable to high-resolution, high-FPS, long-form videos (e.g., 4K-resolution 1K-frame videos).


## 📷 Demo

See the video below for a quick peek of what AutoGaze is capable of! Meanwhile you can also try out the [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bfshi/AutoGaze) on your own video!

## 🎉 Announcement

[2026.4.8] AutoGaze was selected as conference highlight at CVPR2026!

[2026.2.20] AutoGaze got accepted to CVPR2026!

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Create conda environment
conda create -n autogaze python=3.11
conda activate autogaze

# Install CUDA toolkit
# Note: If you've already installed PyTorch, change the cuda version here to the one your PyTorch was built on!
conda install -c nvidia cuda-toolkit=12.8

# Using uv to speedup installations
pip install uv

# Install AutoGaze and its dependencies
uv pip install -e .
```

## 📦 My Installation

Platform-specific installation instructions for environments where the default
`uv pip install -e .` fails due to CUDA/architecture mismatches.

---

### x86_64 — NVIDIA H100 / A100 (CUDA 13.0 driver)

Tested on: `ipp2-2371`, H100 PCIe, Driver 580.x, CUDA 13.0

```bash
# 1. Create and activate conda environment
conda create -y -n auto_gaze python=3.11
conda activate auto_gaze

# 2. Install uv
pip install uv

# 3. Install torch + torchvision (cu130 matches CUDA 13.0 driver)
pip install torch==2.10.0 torchvision==0.25.0 torchaudio==2.10.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130

# 4. Install flash-attn (precompiled wheel available for x86_64 + cu130)
conda install flash-attn -y

# 5. Install remaining dependencies
pip install \
  "hydra-core>=1.3.2" \
  wandb loguru \
  "timm>=1.0.15" \
  tqdm \
  "transformers~=4.51" \
  pillow numpy omegaconf matplotlib einops av imageio

pip install opencv-python-headless

pip install accelerate

# 6. Install AutoGaze in editable mode (deps already installed above)
pip install -e . --no-deps
```

> If `pip install flash-attn` falls back to a source build (takes 30-60 min),
> check that `nvcc --version` matches your torch CUDA version. If nvcc is older
> than the driver's reported CUDA version, add `--no-build-isolation` so flash-attn
> uses the already-installed torch rather than resolving a fresh one.

## 🤖 Training AutoGaze

See [TRAIN.md](https://github.com/NVlabs/AutoGaze/blob/main/TRAIN.md) for how to train AutoGaze.

## 🧩 Integrating AutoGaze into ViTs and MLLMs

We introduce [NVILA-8B-HD-Video](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVILA-8B-HD-Video), an efficient MLLM using AutoGaze. NVILA-8B-HD-Video uses AutoGaze to remove redundant patches before its vision encoder (SigLIP) and LLM, enabling efficient understanding of up to 4K-resolution, 1K-frame videos. This provides an example of how to integrate AutoGaze into ViTs and MLLMs. See the [VILA repo](https://github.com/NVlabs/VILA/tree/main/vila_hd/nvila_hd_video) for instructions on how to use NVILA-8B-HD-Video. See [INTEGRATION.md](https://github.com/NVlabs/AutoGaze/blob/main/INTEGRATION.md) for detailed guidelines on how to integrate AutoGaze into SigLIP and NVILA-HD-Video.

## 🌲 Code Structure

The main package `autogaze` is mainly structured as follows:

```bash
autogaze/
├── configs/
│   ├── algorithm/
│   ├── dataset/
│   ├── model/
│   ├── task/
│   └── trainer/
├── algorithms/
│   ├── grpo.py
│   ├── ntp.py
│   └── ...
├── datasets/
│   ├── video_folder.py
│   └── ...
├── models/
│   ├── autogaze/
│   └── ...
├── tasks/
│   ├── video_mae_reconstruction/
│   └── ...
├── vision_encoders/
│   ├── siglip/
│   └── ...
├── trainer.py
├── train.py
```

The package mainly consists of several components:

- `models`: Definition of **gaze models**, such as AutoGaze. The gaze model is responsible for predicting the gazing for each input video. The model usually takes an input and returns the `gazing_pos` as well as some other auxiliary information for training/inference such as `log_action_probs` of the gazing position and corresponding `gazing_mask`.
- `tasks`: Definition of the **task** serving as the training objective for gaze models, such as video mae reconstruction. Here everything that's related to the task is defined, including the task model (i.e., the model used in the task such as VideoMAE), the loss of the task (e.g., MAE reconstruction loss), or the reward function used to train the gaze model (e.g., reconstruction reward), the metrics used for logging, the visualization methods used during training, etc. Usually, the task class takes in the input video as well as the outputs from the gaze model, and return everything related to the task, such as the outputs from the task model, the task loss, the task reward, the task metrics, etc. As a side use, the task can also be used to train the task model (e.g., VideoMAE) itself.
- `algorithms`: The **algorithm** used to train the gaze model, e.g., next token prediction (NTP) or GRPO. Everything that's related to the algorithm is defined here, such as how the final RL loss is calculated based on the rewards provided by the task class. The algorithm takes in the input video as well as the outputs from the gazing model and task, and outputs the final loss for training the gazing model. Note that the algoirithm is **solely** responsible for training the gaze model, not the task model! The loss for training the task model is already defined in the task class.
- `datasets`: Datasets we use to train gazing models or task models.
- `vision_encoders`: Vision encoders that can be used with AutoGaze. Here you can customize existing vision encoders such as SigLIP or DINOv2 to make them compatible with AutoGaze. We've already implemented SigLIP.
- `trainer.py`: The trainer used to train the gaze model or task model. It takes in the model, task, algorithm, dataset, and train/val the model/task.
- `train.py`: The entry script for training. It instantiates the model, task, RL algorithm, dataset, and trainer, and then launches the trainer.
- `configs`: Configs for everything above.

This modularized structure allows easily adding new models, tasks, and algorithms, data, etc. For example, to add a task of DINOv2 feature reconstruction, one only needs to define a new task class without touching other parts. Sometimes adding some new features require changing multiple components, for example, adding a new task of Kinetics video classification will require defining the new task and adding a new Kinetics dataset.
